# Replicating Python Script
The script works by injecting its Python code into other Python files. The code is very much obvious and clearly visible for anyone
developing the infected file(s). Script can only move upward through directories and will infect everysingle file availible.
For best results launch from root of file system.
## Important
This code is purely educational and anything you should choose to do with it is entirely your own. I am not liable for any 
damage.
